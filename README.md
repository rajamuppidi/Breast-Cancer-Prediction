# Breast Cancer Prediction with SVM

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on the breast cancer dataset. It includes data loading, model preparation, k-fold cross-validation without hyperparameter tuning, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold, and evaluation on the test dataset.

## Installation

To set up this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
